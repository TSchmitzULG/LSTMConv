# LSTMConv
Improve long short time memory neural-nework speed by dimensional reduction: a non linear emulation of a tubes amplifier in real-time application

  Learn LSTM ICASSP is used to learn new model from a dataset
  Real-Time Emulation of LSTM is used to emulate the model in real time by applying it on input guitar signal. Clone the git    directory to your computer and launch the notebook ".ipynb" file. Don't forget to install the required libraries (tensorflow,cuda,numpy,matplotlib,pyaudio,...).
